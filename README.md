Weather Dashboard application (Forte Group FE
assignment)
Create a Weather Dashboard application where users can:

1. Search for a city to get current weather details.
2. View the current weather, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
3. Save favorite cities and view their weather data.
4. Remove a city from the list of favorites.
   API:
   Use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. You can sign up for a free API key here. (first
   1000 API calls per day are free)

   Requirements:
   ● HTML/CSS:
   ○ Design a simple and user-friendly interface using semantic HTML5.
